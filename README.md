More sensible interface is on the way

TODO:  
  -Ability to snap the image to other corners of the wallpaper  
  -Ability to flip (rotate?) the input image  
  -Ability to rescale the input image in relation to the wallpaper size  
  -Ability to run filters (such as constraining the color space of image)  
  -Better interface than changing code in .py files
